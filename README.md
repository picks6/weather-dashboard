# Deployed site is now live:
https://picks6.github.io/weather-dashboard/

# How it works
A user can search for a city and the site will make an API call to Openweathermap. This will return
the current forecast as well as the 5 day outlook. Searches are saved to local storage and can be
recalled via a clickable button
